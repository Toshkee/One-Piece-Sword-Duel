                One Piece-Sword Duel

# ⚔️ One Piece - Sword Duel

A **One Piece themed 2D fighting game** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 🎮 Game Concept
- Two One Piece characters fight each other with their **swords**.  
- Each character has their **own health bar** displayed at the top of the screen.  
- A **timer** runs in the middle of the health bars — if time runs out, the fighter with the most health wins.  
- Characters can **move left, move right, and jump**.  
- When a character wins, they will **shout their unique attack move name** from the anime (e.g., *"Onigiri!"* or *"Divine Departure!"*).  
- A **One Piece themed background** sets the stage.  
- At the end of the match, a **Restart button** appears so you can play again.  
- Includes **win/lose conditions**.
